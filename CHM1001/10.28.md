## First Order Reactions
Some rates depend only on one reactant to the first power

Besides using the rate law, we can find the rate constant from the plot of ln [A] vs. t

$$\ln\left[A\right]=-kt+\ln\left[A\right]_{\circ}$$

## Second Order Reactions
Some rates depend only on a reactant to the second power

The rate law becomes:$Rate=k\left[A\right]^2$

## Zero Order Reactions
Occasionally, rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant:$Rate=k$

## The Collision Model

In a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and new bonds are formed.

Molecules can only react if they collide with each other.

Furthermore, molecules must collide with the correct orientation and with enough energy to cause bond breakage and formation.

Molecules can often collide without forming products

Aligning molecules properly can lead to chemical reactions

Bonds must be broken and made and atoms need to be in proper positions

## The Relationship Between Activation Energy & Temperature

Svante Arrhenius noted relationship between activation energy and temperature:

$$k=Ae^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}$$

Activation energy can be determined graphically by reorganizing the equation:

$$\ln k=\frac{E_a}{RT}+\ln A$$

## Reaction Mechanisms
Each of these processes is known as an elementary reaction or elementary process

The rate law must be able to be devised from the rate-determining step

The stoichiometry must be obtained when all steps are added up

Each step must balance, like any equation

All intermediates are made and used up

Any catalyst is used and regenerated

## Catalysts
Catalysts increase the rate of a reaction by decreasing the activation energy of the reaction

Catalysts change the mechanism by which the process occurs

+ Homogeneous catalysts
+ Heterogeneous catalysts
+ Enzymes
### Homogeneous catalysts
The reactants and catalyst are in the same phase

Many times, reactants and catalyst are dissolved in the same solvent, as seen below

### Heterogeneous Catalysts
The catalyst is in a different phase than the reactants

Often, gases are passed over a solid catalyst

The adsorption of the reactants is often the rate-determining step

### Enzymes
Enzymes are biological catalysts

They have a region where the reactants attach. That region is called the active site. The reactants are referred to as substrates
