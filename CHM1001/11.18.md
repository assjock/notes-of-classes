## Enthalpy
Enthalpy is the internal energy plus the product of pressure and volume
$$H=E+PV$$

## Hess's Law
Hess’s law: If a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, H for the overall reaction will be equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps

Because $\Delta H$ is a state function, the total enthalpy change depends only on the initial state (reactants) and the final state (products) of the reaction

## Enthalpies of Formation
An enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_f$, is defined as the enthalpy change for the reaction in which a compound is made from its constituent elements in their elemental forms

## Entropy
Entropy is a measure of the randomness in a system

Both play a role in determining whether a process is spontaneous

It is a state function:
$$\Delta S=S_{final}-S_{initial}$$

For an isothermal (constant T) reversible process, change in entropy is equal to heat transferred divided by temperature
$$\Delta S=\frac{q_{rev}}{T}$$

At phase transition temperature T0, any transfer of heat between the system and its surroundings is reversible
$$\Delta S=\frac{Q_{rev}}{T_0}=\frac{\Delta H}{T_{0}}$$

The connection between the number of microstates and the entropy of the system is (W represents the number of microstates)
$$S=k\ln W$$

## Spontaneous Processes
**Spontaneous processes** proceed without any outside assistance

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
The entropy of the universe increases in any spontaneous processes. Total entropy of an isolated system always increases or remains constant
