## Acid-Base Equilibrium
### Strong vs. Weak Acids Another Comparison
Strong Acid: $[H^+]_{eq}=[HA]_{init}$

Weak Acid: $[H^+]_{eq}<[HA]_{init}$

This creates a difference in conductivity and in rates of chemical reactions

### Polyprotic Acids
Polyprotic acids have more than one acidic proton

If the factor in the Ka values for the first and second dissociation has a difference of 3 or greater, the pH generally depends only on the first dissociation

### Weak Bases
Like weak acids, weak bases have an equilibrium constant called **the base dissociation constant**

Equilibrium calculations work the same as for acids, using the base dissociation constant instead

Types of Weak Bases:
+ Neutral substances with an Atom that has a nonbonding pair of electrons that can accept $H^+$ (like ammonia and the amines)
+ Anions of weak acids

For a conjugate acid–base pair, Ka and Kb are related in this way:

$$K_a\times K_b=K_w$$

## Acid–Base Properties of Salts
Many ions react with water to create $H^+$ or $OH^–$. The reaction with water is often called hydrolysis

To determine whether a salt is an acid or a base, you need to look at the cation and anion separately

The cation can be acidic or neutral

The anion can be acidic, basic, or neutral

### Binary Acids
Binary acids consist of H and one other element

Within a group, H-A bond strength is generally the most important factor

Within a period, bond polarity is the most important factor to determin acid strength

### Oxyacids
Oxyacids consist of H, O, and one other element, which is a nonmetal

Generally, as the electronegativity of the nonmetal increases, the acidity increases for acids with the same structure

If an element can form more than one oxyacid, the oxyacid with more O atoms is more acidic

## Lewis Acid/Base
Lewis acids are electron pair acceptors

Lewis bases are electron pair donors

All Brønsted–Lowry acids and bases are also called Lewis acids and bases

There are compounds which do not meet the Brønsted–Lowry definition which meet the Lewis definition
