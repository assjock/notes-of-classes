## Packing efficiecy
$$packing\%=\frac{V_{atom}}{V_{cube}}$$

## A MO approach
As the number of atoms in a chain increases, the energy gap between the bonding orbitals and between the antibonding orbitals disappears, resulting in a **continuous band** of energy

## Ionic solids
In ionic solids, the lattice comprises alternately charged ions

Ionic solids have very high melting and boiling points and are quintessential crystals

The size of the cation compared to the anion (radius ratio) is the major factor in which structure is seen for ionic compounds

## Molecular solids
Consist of atoms or molecules held together by weaker forces (dispersion, dipole–dipole, or hydrogen bonds)

## Covalent-Networkk solids
Atoms are covalently bonded over large network distances with regular patterns of atoms

Tend to have higher melting and boiling points

## Semiconductors
They have a gap between the occupied MOs (valence band) and the unoccupied ones (conduction band)

Electrons must enter the conduction band for electron transfer.

changing the conductivity of semiconductors by adding an element with more or fewer electrons

**n-type semiconductors** have more electrons, so the negative charge travels in the conductance band

**p-type semiconductors** have fewer electrons, so the “hole” travels in the valence band

## Polymers
**Polymers** are molecules of high molecular weight made by joining smaller molecules, called monomers

**Addition polymers** are formed when a bond breaks, and the electrons in that bond make two new bonds

**Condensation polymers** are formed when a small molecule is removed between two large molecules

## Nanomaterials
Particles that have three dimensions on the 1–100 nm size
