### Amphoterism
Amphoteric oxides and hydroxides are soluble in strong acids or base, because they can act either as acids or bases

## Thermochemistry
Definitions: System and Surroundings

The system includes the molecules we want to study

The surroundings are everything else

**First Law of Thermodynamics**:

Energy is neither created nor destroyed

### Internal Energy
The internal energy of a system is the sum of all kinetic and potential energies of all components of the system; we call it E
$$\Delta E=E_{final}-E_{initial}$$

When heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings, the process is endothermic

When heat is released by the system into the surroundings, the process is exothermic

the internal energy of a system is independent of the path by which the system achieved that state

### State Function
Therefore, internal energy is a state function

It depends only on the present state of the system, not on the path by which the system arrived at that state

However, q and w are not state functionss

### Work
We can measure the work done by the gas if the reaction is done in a vessel that has been fitted with a piston
$$w=P\Delta V$$
where P is the external pressure

If a process takes place at constant pressure and the only work done is this pressureâ€“volume work, we can account for heat flow during the process by measuring the enthalpy of the system

Enthalpy is the internal energy plus the product of pressure and volume
$$H=E+PV$$

At constant pressure, the change in enthalpy is the heat gained or lost
