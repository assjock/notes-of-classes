## What is chemistry
化学 change of science

a science discipline that deals with the change of matter
at the molecular level

We describe the universe using an atomic and
molecular perspective


## Electronic Structure of Atoms
~~念ppt的物理课~~

**wavelength** $\lambda$:The distance between corresponding points
on adjacent waves is the wavelength

**frequency** $v$ :The number of waves passing a given point per unit of time is the frequency

The speed of light (c) is $3.00 \times 10^8$ m/s, $c=\lambda v$

The energy of light is related to its frequency: $E=hv$,h = Planck’s constant $= 6.626\times 10^{-34} Js$

*The laser in most supermarket barcode scanners operates at a wavelength of 632.8 nm. What is the energy of a single photon emitted by such a laser?*

quanta:量子的 photon:光量子

The Photoelectric Effect:Energy is proportional to frequency, Each metal has a different energy at which it  ejects electrons. At lower energy, electrons are not emitted

For atoms and molecules, one does not observe a **continuous spectrum**, each element has a unique **line spectrum**.When atoms or molecules get excited by electricity or heat, the light spectrum consists of lines of **discrete(离散的)** wavelength, not a continuum.

### The Hydrogen Spectrum

Johannes Rydberg advanced this formula:

$\frac{1}{\lambda}=(R_{H})(\frac{1}{n_1^2}-\frac{1}{n_2^2})$

### The Bohr Model
principle quantum number:主量子数

The other energy (excited states) states
farther away from the nucleus are less
stable

The energy absorbed or emitted from the process of electron promotion or demotion can be calculated by the equation

$\Delta E=hcR_{H}(\frac{1}{n_1^2}-\frac{1}{n_2^2})$

where $R_H$ is the Rydberg constant, $1.097\times 107 m^{−1}$, and $n_i$ and $n_f$ are the **initial and final energy levels** of the electron.

*LIMITATIONS*
+ only works on hydrogen
+ Circular motion is not wave-like in nature

### The Wave Nature of Matter

the relationship between mass and wavelength

$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$

*Find the de Broglie wavelength for a tennis ball moving at the speed of 10.0 m/s. The mass of the tennis ball is 0.060 kg*

### The Uncertainty Principle

Heisenberg showed that the more precisely the momentum of a particle is known, the less precisely is its position is known:

$(\Delta x)(\Delta mv)\ge\frac{h}{4\pi}$

It shows us the uncertainty of the position of a electron can be greater than the size of the atom.

### Quantum Mechanics(量子力学)

Erwin Schrödinger developed a mathematical treatment into which both the wave and particle nature of matter could be incorporated(包含), The square of the wave equation,$\phi^2$, gives the **electron density(密度)**

The solution of wave equation gives us the orbitals

**The principal quantum number$n$** describes the energy level.

**Angular momentum quantum number(角动量量子数)$l$** defines the shape of the orbital
