If a linear system has no solution, we say that the system is **inconsistent**

If the system has at least one solution, we say that it is **consistent** Row Echelon Form

A matrix is said to be in **row echelon form** if

+  The first nonzero entry in each nonzero row is 1

+  If row $k$ does not consist entirely of zeros, the number of leading zero entries in row $k + 1$ is greater than the number of leading zero entries in row $k$

+ If there are rows whose entries are all zero, they are below the rows having nonzero entries

e.g. 

$A=\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}3&1&6&9&3\\0&5&3&7&6\\0&6&9&1&1\\0&0&0&1&9\end{array}\right]$

## Reduced Row Echelon Form

A matrix is said to be in **reduced row echelon form** if

+ The matrix is in row echelon form

+ The first nonzero entry in each row is the only nonzero entry in its column

e.g.

$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\end{array}\right]$

## Homogeneous Systems

A system of linear equations is said to be **homogeneous** if the constants on the righthand side are all zero

An $m \times n$ homogeneous system of linear equations has a nontrivial solution if $n > m$

Proof:

A homogeneous system is always consistent. The row echelon form of the matrix can have at most $m$ nonzero rows. Thus there are at most $m$ lead variables. Since there are $n$ variables altogether and $n > m$, there must be some free variables. The free variables can be assigned arbitrary values. For each assignment of values to the free variables, there is a solution of the system.
