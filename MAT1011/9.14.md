## One-side limit

Assume the domain of $f$ contains an interval $(c, d)$. We say that $f(x)$ has right-hand limit $L$ at $c$, and write:

$$\lim_{x\to c^+}f(x)=L$$

if for every number $ε > 0$ there exists a corresponding number
$δ > 0$ such that

$|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$ whenever $x\in (c,c+\delta)$

The definition of the left-hand limit is similar

Suppose that $f(x)$ is defined on an open interval containing $c$, except perhaps at $c$ itself. Then $f(x)$ has a limit as $x$ approaches $c$ if and only if

1. it has left-hand and right-hand limits there

2. these one-sided limits are equal

## Continuity
Let $c$ be a real number that is either an interior point or an endpoint of an interval in the domain of $f$

+ $f$ is continuous at $c$ if

$$\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)$$

+ $f$ is right-continuous at $c$ (or continuous from the right) if

$$\lim_{x\to c^+}f(x)=f(c)$$

+ $f$ is left-continuous at $c$ (or continuous from the left) if

$$\lim_{x\to c^-}f(x)=f(c)$$

$D(x)=\left\{\begin{aligned}&1,&\text{if x is rational}\\&2,&\text{if x is irrational}\end{aligned}\right.$

D is not continuous at any point

$\zeta(x)=\left\{\begin{aligned}&\frac{1}{q},&\text{if } x \text{ is rational }x=\frac{p}{q}\\&0,&\text{if x is irrational}\end{aligned}\right.$

$\zeta$ is continuous at all irrational numbers,
discontinuous at all rational numbers

When $I = (a, b)$ is an open interval, we say $f$ is continuous on $(a, b)$ if $f$ is continuous at every interior point in $(a, b)$

When $I = [a, b]$ is a closed interval, we say $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ if $f$ is continuous at every interior point in $(a, b)$ and
continuous from one-side at each endpoint
