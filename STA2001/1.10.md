## Properties of Probability
### Difinitions
Experiement: Any procedure that can be repeated infinitely many times and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes.

Random experiment: An experiment is said to be random if it has more than one possible outcomes

Sample space: Given a random experiment, the collection of all possible outcomes is called the sample space, denoted by $S$

Event: Given a sample space $S$, an event $A$ is a set that contains part of outcomes in $S$, and $A \subset S$

$A$ has occurred: When a random experiment is performed, if the outcome of the experiment is in $A$, then we say that the event $A$ has occurred

### Set Theory
Sets $A_1,A_1,\cdots,A_k$ are said to be:
1. mutually exclusive: $\forall i,j \in \{1,2,\cdots,k\},A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset$
2. exhaustive: $\cup_{i=1}^k A_i=S$
3. mutually exclusive and exhastive: both 1 and 2

### Defintion of probability
Let $N(A)$ be the number of times that event $A$ occurs in n times experiment, the relative frequency of event $A$ is $\frac{N(A)}{n}$

The probability of A: $P(A)=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\frac{N(A)}{n}$

A real-valued, set function $P$ that assigns to each event $A$ in the sample space $S$, a number $P(A)$, called the probability of the event $A$ such that the following properties are satisfied:
1. $P(A)\geq 0$
2. $P(S)=1$
3. if $A_1,A_2,\cdots,A_k$ are countable and mutually exclusive events
$$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup\cdots)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+\cdots$$

### Some properties
1. For each event $A$. $P(A)=1-P(A')$
2. $P(\emptyset)=0$
3. If events $A$ and $B$ are such that $A \subset B$, then $P(A)\leq P(B)$

proof of 3:
$$B=B\cup A=(B\cup A)\cap S=(B\cup A)\cap(A\cup A')=(B\cap A')\cup A$$

$$P(B)=P(A\cup(B\cap A'))=P(A)+P(B\cap A')\geq P(A)$$

4. For each event $A$, $P(A)\leq 1$
5. For any two event $A$ and $B$, $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)=P(A\cap B)$
