## Conditional probability
Under the assumptions that:
1. $S$ is finite
2. All outcomes are "equally likely"
the conditional probability of an event $A$, given that the event $B$ has occurred, is defined by $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

$B$ is the sample space of $P(A|B)$

Conditional probability satisfies the probability axioms

1. $P(A|B)\geq 0$
2. $P(B|B)=1$
3. If $A_1, A_2,\dots$ are countable and mutually exclusive events, then $$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup\cdots|B)=P(A_1|B)+P(A_2|B)+\cdots$$

The probability that two events, $A$ and $B$ both occur is given by the multiplication rule
$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A)=P(B)P(A|B)$$

## Independent Events
The occurence of $A$ does not affect the probability of the occurrence of $B$. They are called independent events.
$$P(B|A)=P(B)$$
$$P(A|B)=P(A)$$
$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$$
