### program flows
+ sequential flow: flows from step by step
```python
x=2
print(x)
x=x*10
print(x)
```
+ conditional flow: branches
```python
x=5
if x<10:
    print('smaller')
if x>20:
    print('larger')
print('finished')
```

+ repeated flow: 
```python
n=5
while n>0:
    print(n)
    n=n-1
print('finish')
```
