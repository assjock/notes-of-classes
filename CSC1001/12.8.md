## Tree
Tree: A set of nodes storing elements s.t. the nodes have a parent-child relationship

Edge of tree T is a pair of nodes (u,v) s.t. u is the parent of v. or vice versa

A path of tree T is a sequence of nodes s.t. any two consecutive nodes in the sequence form an edge

The depth of a node v is the length of the path connecting root node and v

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:
1. Every node has at most two children
2. Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child
3. A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node

```python
class Node::
    def __init__(self,v):
        self.e=v
        self.left=None
        self.right=None
class bTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root=None
        self.size=0
    def addRoot(self,v):
        if self.root==None:
            node=Node(e)
            self.root=node
            self.size+=1
        else:
            print('The root is already exsiting')
    def addLeft(self,p,v):
        if p.left==None:
            p.left=Node(v)
            return p.left
        else:
            print('p is already has left child')
    def addRight(self,p.b):
        if p.right is None:
            p.right=Node(v)
            return p.right
        else:
            print('p is already has right child')
```

## DFS&BFS
```python
def DFS(p):
    if p is None:
        return
    print(p.e)
    DFS(p.left)
    DFS(p.right)
```

```python
def BFS(t):
    Q=linkQueue()
    Q.enqueue(t)
    while Q is_empty()==False:
        p=Q.dequeue()
        print(p.e)
        if p.left is not None:
            Q.enqueue(p.left)
        if p.right is not None:
            Q.enqueue(p.right)
```
