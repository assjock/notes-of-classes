## Recurtion
Recursion is a  technique by which a function makes one or more call to itself during execution

```python
def f(n):
    return n*f(n-1)
f(n)
```

## Algorithm
example of algorithm:
```python
l=[1,235,6,27,53,38]
def search(n,l):
    position=-1
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i]==n:
            position=n
            break
    return position
```

another example:
```python
def bsearch(t,l,low high):
    if low>high:
        return -1
    mid=(low+high)//2
    if t>l[mid]:
        return bsearch(t,l,mid+1,high)
    elif t<l[mid]:
        return bsearch(t,l,low,mid-1)
    else:
        return mid
def binarysearch(n,l):
    return bsearch(t,l,0,len(l)-1)
```

## Measure the running time
We can use `time()` to get the time

```python
from time import time
startTime=time()
#your code 
endTime=time()
print(endTime-startTime)
```

## data structure
A data structure is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time
