## Python basics
TIPS

+ Use meaningful words as variable names

+ Start with a lower letter

+ Capitalize the first letter of each word

**Cascaded assignment**

set multiple variables into the same value using a single assignment statement

```python
x=y=z=9
```
**Simultaneous assignment**

The values of two variables can be exchanged using simultaneous
assignment

```python
x='hallo'
y=5
x,y=y,x
```

### Order evaluation
1. Parenthesis are always with highest priority

2. Power

3. Multiplication, division and remainder

4. Addition and subtraction

5. Left to right

Floor division

`9//2.5`

divmod()

`divmod()`

Augmented assignment 

(just some examples, we have * ** / etc.)
```python
x=22
x+=7 #equivalent to x=x+7
x-=5 #equivalent to x=x-5
```

## Data Type

variables and constants have an associated "type"

**conversion**

`int()  float()  str()` etc.

*BMI = weight (kg) รท height ^ 2 (m)  (coding)*

```python
oneWeight=float(input('pls type you weight:'))
oneHeight=float(input('pls type you height:'))
print(oneWeight/oneHeight**2)
```
