## Algorithm analysis
Principle of algorithm analysis 1: Counting primitive operations

We define a set of primitive operations such as the following:
+ Assigning an variable to an object
+ Determining the object associated with an variable
+ Performing an arithmetic operation (for example, adding two numbers)
+ Comparing two numbers
+ Accessing a single element of a Python list by index
+ Calling a function (excluding operations executed within the function)
+ Returning from a function

Principle of algorithm analysis 2: Measuring Operations as a Function of Input Size

To capture the order of growth of an algorithmâ€™s running time, we will associate, with each algorithm, a function f (n) that characterizes the number of primitive operations that are performed as a function of the problem size n

## Sort
select sort
```python
def selectSort(a):
    L=list()
    flag[True]*len(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        smallest_so_far=None
        pos =None
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if flag[j]==False:
                continue
            if smallest_so_far is None:
                smallest_so_far=a[j]
                pos=j
            if smallest_so_far >a[j]:
                smallest_so_far=a[j]
                pos=j
        flag[pos]=False
        l.append(smallest_so_far)
    return L
```

insert sort
```python
def insertSort(a):
    def locate(t,L):
        if len(L)==0:
            return 0
        for i in range(len(L)):
            if t<L[i]:
                return i
        return len(L)
    L=list()
    for t in a:
        p=locate(t,L)
        L.insert(p,t)
```
