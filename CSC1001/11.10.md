## Overriding methods

## The object class
Every class in Python is descended from the object class

The object class is defined in the Python library. If no inheritance is specified when a class is defined, its superclass is object by default

Methods of the object class:
The \_\_new__() method is automatically invoked when an object is constructed. This method then invokes the \_\_init__() method to initialize the object. Normally you should only override the \_\_init__() method to initialize the data fields defined in the new class

The \_\_str__() method returns a string description for the object

## Polymorphism and dynamic binding
Polymorphism means that the objects of different classes can be passed as arguments to the same function

Dynamic binding works as follows: Suppose an object o is an instance of classes C1, C2, ..., Cn-1, and Cn, where C1 is a subclass of C2, C2 is a subclass of C3, ..., and Cn-1 is a subclass of Cn

## Multiple inheritance
```python
class a:
    ##sth
class b:
    ##sth
class c(a,b):
    a.__init__()
    b.__init__()
    ##sth
```
