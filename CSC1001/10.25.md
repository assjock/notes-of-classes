## List
List constants are surrounded by square brackets and the elements in the list are separated by commas

Strings are “immutable” – we cannot change the contents of a string unless we make a new string

Lists are “mutable” – we can change an element of a list using index operator

the `len()` function takes a list as input and returns the number of elements in that list

The `range()` function returns a list of numbers

```python
>>>list(range(4))
[0,1,2,3,4]
>>>list(range(0,6,2))
[0,2,4,6]
>>>list(range(7,1))
[]
```

The list can be sliced using `a[1:2]`

We can create an empty list using list(), and then add elements using append() method

A list can hold many items and keeps them in the order until we do something to change the order by the function `sorted()` or `l.sort()`

function `split()`

```python
>>>a='1 2 3 4 5'
>>>a.split()##a.split(' ')
['1','2','3','4','5']
```
