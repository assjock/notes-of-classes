## Class
If we want to use classes in the other files, we can use `from #1 import #2`

### Private data fields
Prevent other programmers from directly accessing the data fields of your class is a common industrial practice

In Python, the private data fields are defined with two leading underscores. You can also define a private method named with two leading underscores

## Abstraction
Abstraction means separate the implementation of a part of code from the usage of that code

Function abstraction means separating the implementation of a function from its usage

Abstraction makes your code easy to maintain, debug and reuse

Class abstraction means separating class implementation from the use of a class

The class implementation details are invisible from the user

The class’s collection of methods, together with the description of how these methods are expected to behave, serves as the class’s contract with the client

## Inheritance
The object-oriented programming couples data and methods together into objects

A subclass inherits accessible data fields and methods from its superclass, but it can also have other data fields and methods

```python
class GeometricObject:
    #something to be written
class Circle(GeometircObject):
    super().__init__()
    #something to be filled
    #some more info and methods about Circle()
```

## Overriding methods
Sometimes it is necessary for the subclass to modify the implementation of a method defined in the superclass. This is referred to as method overriding

The \_\_str__ method in the GeometricObject class returns the string describing a geometric object. This method can be overridden to return the string describing a circle

The \_\_str__() method is defined in the GeometricObject class and modified in the Circle class. Both methods can be used in the Circle class. To invoke the \_\_str__ method defined in the GeometricObject class from the Circle class, use super().\_\_str__()
