## Sort
bubble sort
```python
def bubbleSort(a):
    n=len(a)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(n-1-i):
            if a[j]>a[j+1]:
                t=a[j]
                a[j]=a[j+1]
                a[j+1]=t
    return a
```
Time complexity: O(n^2)

quick sort
```python
def quickSort(a,low,high):#low=0 high=len(a)-1
    i=low
    j=high
    if i>=j:
        return a
    key=a[i]
    while i<j:
        while i<j and a[j]>key:
            j-=1
        a[i]=a[j]
        while j<j and a[i]<key:
            i+=1
        a[j]=a[i]
    a[i]=key
    quickSort(a,low,i-1)
    qiuckSort(a,j+1,high)
    return a
```
Time complexity O(nlogn)

## Stack
Stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in, first-out principle

A user may insert objects into a stack at any time, but may only access or remove the most recently inserted object that remains(at the so-called 'top' of the stack)
