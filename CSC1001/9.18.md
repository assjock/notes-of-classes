## User input

we can instruct Python to stop and take user inputs by

`input()`

`input()` always returns a string

## Comments

comments are after `#`

word after `#` will be ignored by python

### why comments?

describe what is going to happen in your sequence of code 

document who wrote the code and other important things

turn off a line of code

## String oprator

we use \+ or , to connect two strings

*input two of your friends's name and print 'I am the friend of XX and XX'*
```python
a=input('pls input your friends name 1')
b=input('pls input your friends name 2')
print('I am the friend of '+a+ ' and '+b+'.')
```

or 

```python
a=input('pls input your friends name 1')
b=input('pls input your friends name 2')
print('I am the friend of ',a, ' and ',b+'.')
```

for the function `print()`, we can use `print(sep='x')` to control the seperators

use the `print(end='\n')` to control the end of the print line

## eval()

```python
eval('5+12')    #Only a string type
>>>17
```

```python
a,b=eval(4,2)
print(a)
print(b)
>>>4
2
```

```python
a=eval(12,3)
print(a)
>>>(12,3)
```
